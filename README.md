# AI for Good summit

Just attended the incredible #AI for Good summit, a global initiative driving positive change through the power of #artificialintelligence. It's inspiring to see experts, organizations, and governments come together to explore practical applications of AI in advancing the United Nations' #SustainableDevelopment Goals (SDGs). From #healthcare to #education, #sustainability to humanitarian aid, AI has the potential to transform the #world for the better.

During the summit, I could discuss the use of Evolwe technologies in #robotics and especially smart companion in settings to improve the world's #wellbeing and promote sustainability. It was amazing to explore the innovative developments and how AI can positively impact our lives. The potential for AI to enhance well-being and contribute to a more sustainable future is truly remarkable.

I was honored to be invited to this summit by Stephen Ibaraki , whose expertise and dedication to advancing AI for social good are truly commendable. Additionally, I had the pleasure of meeting Stephen Hetch at the summit, and we had insightful discussions about #potential cooperation on well-being initiatives. Collaborations like these are essential in driving meaningful change and creating a brighter future for all.

I'm grateful to be part of this inclusive platform, co-convened with Switzerland and organized by ITU in partnership with 40 UN Sister Agencies. Together, we're paving the way for a brighter, more sustainable future. Attending this summit has reaffirmed my belief in the power of #collaboration and #innovation to drive positive change. Let's continue working together to harness the potential of AI and robotics for a brighter, more sustainable #future.
